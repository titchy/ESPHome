# ESPHome-FoxESS-modbus

This repo is a store for ESPHome modbus configurations for various devices.

It was started to store the configuration for my FoxESS H1-5.0-E inverter.

I use the circuit depicted here to connect to my inverter with ESPHome: https://github.com/assembly12/Foxess-T-series-ESPHome-Home-Assistant/wiki/Hardware-setup Though I have switched the temperature sensor module from an AHT10 to a bme280 which seems much better at functioning and uses the same connector on the circuit board.
