# ESPHome-FoxESS-modbus

This repo is a store for ESPHome modbus configurations for various devices.
It was started to store the configuration for my FoxESS H1-5.0-E inverter.
I use the circuit depicted here to connect to my inverter with ESPHome: https://github.com/assembly12/Foxess-T-series-ESPHome-Home-Assistant/wiki/Hardware-setup
